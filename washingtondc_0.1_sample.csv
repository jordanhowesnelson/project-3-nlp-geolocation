I live in an apartment in DC that is run by a large known management company.  
I have an on going leak from an outer wall every time it rains for over a year! The leak creates puddles on the floor when it rains hard and ruined already my kitchen table.  
The whole wall have water stains and the paint is cracking. I'm pretty sure there is mold in the wall also.

I contacted the management multiple times during that year and got repeating promises to fix the leak with nothing really being done, they painting the inside which didn't really help other then to cover the leak for couple of month until it leaked through the new paint as well.

  
I asked for a month rent compensation for my trouble and the on going issues and was only offered to move to another apartment which is downgrade with a ""waived fee"" which is a joke in my mind. Not only the apartment is not in good condition they punish me as well by a move that i need to bare the cost of.

Typically when a hurricane is heading towards a region of the country, we like to engage people in that region and invite them to contribute and ask questions at /r/tropicalweather. We're a group of seasoned vets, professional meteorologists, and hobby weather enthusiasts who track these systems year round. We've done the live thread for the sitewide Reddit for Irma and Harvey.

Currently, it appears that NoVa is one of many places that could be under the gun. Already, North Carolina has declared a State of Emergency, and other declarations from other states are likely to follow depending on if this storm tracks north or south.

What prompted us visiting DC is the latest rain forecast from what this storm may do, according to the euro model.
